Omok

### Omok & Gomoku board/GUI, client + server, and AI in one package

To compile the board/client, simply clone this repo, make sure maven is installed on your computer, and type `mvn package`.

This will create three runnable jars inside the `target` folder. `Client` and `Server` will include the full dependency and run.

Descriptions of what each class does and how they work (especially the step, hash, and calculateScores functions in Jack) will come as soon as I fix Jack's Alpha-Beta pruning behavior.

Check the `TODO`'s on each file to get a glimpse of future improvements & optimizations
